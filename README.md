# Dredge Mods Website
A website for DREDGE mods.

The site contains a list of all mods generated off of the [DREDGE mod database](https://github.com/xen-42/DredgeModDatabase). A page is created for each mod with some general info (author, download count, description), and the body of the page will display the readme from that mod's GitHub repo.

The site is also meant to direct users to the [DREDGE mod manager](https://github.com/xen-42/DredgeModManager), which is used to install and manage mods from the database.
